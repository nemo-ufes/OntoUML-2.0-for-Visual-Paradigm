# OntoUML 2.0 Plugin for Visual Paradigm

This repository contains a plug-in for Visual Paradigm that enables model verification for the already published portion of OntoUML 2.0.

This is a work in progress as OntoUML 2.0 does not cover yet all modeling features of traditional OntoUML. You can find more information on scope of this implementation  on our papers [[1]](http://www.inf.ufes.br/~gguizzardi/ER2018-OntoUML.pdf) and [[2]](http://www.inf.ufes.br/~gguizzardi/Relations_in_Ontology-Driven_Conceptual.pdf).

In case of questions, sugestions, features requests or bug report, you are welcome to contact us via [e-mail](cmoraisfonseca@unibz.it) or to creation an issue within this repository.
